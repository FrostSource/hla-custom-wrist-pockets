# HLA Custom Wrist Pocket Holograms

> This project is currently in Beta to make sure the way it works is suitable for the majority of developers. I am looking for feedback from developers implementing this system in their addon.

This project aims to solve the issue of wrist holograms for custom props appearing as health pen syringes. Any prop that can be stored inside the wrist can now have a matching icon with very minimal effort.
